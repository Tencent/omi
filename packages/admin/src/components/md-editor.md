## Markdown Basic Syntax

I just love **bold text**. Italicized text is the _cat's meow_. At the command prompt, type `nano`.

My favorite markdown editor is [ByteMD](https://github.com/bytedance/bytemd).

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

```js
import { Editor, Viewer } from 'bytemd';
import gfm from '@bytemd/plugin-gfm';

const plugins = [
  gfm(),
  // Add more plugins here
];

const editor = new Editor({
  target: document.body, // DOM to render
  props: {
    value: '',
    plugins,
  },
});

editor.on('change', (e) => {
  editor.$set({ value: e.detail.value });
});
```

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.
